### Source Code

**Contains:**

* Source code written in C++
* Project setup instructions in a TXT file.
* Uses OpenGL vertex and fragment shaders.
	* No compute shaders. However, the way the fragment shader is written, it can be written as a compute shader, that can be plugged into Unity Shaders, if one wishes to do so.
* Uses coding principles commonly found with ShaderToy shaders.
	* It might be easy for someone to apply ShaderToy shaders directly into the fragment shader without changing too much of the C++ source codes.
* The planned Chapter 3 of the book was supposed to cover the source code, and explain how and why the code is written as such. It's just due to lack of motivation on the author's part, that it would be better to take a break before the author's motivation returns.
* Too much time has passed, and the author's original notes were lost. Not satisfied, the author felt it would be safer to upload the source codes before it disappears completely.
* The author still welcomes any contributions, and will gladly have discussions about them.
	* Despite this, the author worries that GitHub contributions aren't going to happen. At least, the author is hopeful there will be one someday...
* If the application is not running too smoothly, either updating the graphics cards drivers or restarting the computer will tend to help. Basic troubleshooting at its finest, don't you think?

Happy New Year!
